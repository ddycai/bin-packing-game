Bin Packing
===========

You've heard about bin packing, but have you ever tried it yourself? Well you're in luck!

In this game, you are asked to solve a bin packing problem: put the items into bins using as few
bins as possible. The computer (AKA the next guy) will also solve the problem using approximation
algorithms First Fit and First Fit Descending. Since this problem is NP-Hard, there is no exact
algorithm for it. Can you beat the next guy?

Written using React.js and jQuery. Uses jQuery UI for dragging/dropping. Written to help me learn
React and (kind of) to look at how simple approximation algorithms work in practice.
